# sql-online-store-project

## Overview
This repository contains code blocks to create databases, update, alter, and queries for online store using mySQL. The purpose of the project is for personal practice and showcase of beginner level mySQL skills, while also answering some basic business analysis questions. Questions to answer were purely generated by chatGPT, given limitation of basic mySQL queries (listed below).

There are 3 different files:
1. OnlineRetailStore.sql - contains the main code of DB and table creations, basic and advanced queries related to business analytics questions
2. GenerateSeries.sql - stored procedure to generate random orders, which is an integral of generate_series() in PostgreSQL since mySQL doesn't have this built-in.
3. RandNameProc.sql - stored procedure to generate random customer names in which was used to populate customer data.

This repository showcases basic query skills in mySQL using common queries such as:
SELECT, FROM, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, UPDATE, INSERT, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DATETIME, FLOOR, RAND, TIMESTAMP, CASE, LIMIT, ROLLUP, TRIGGER, PROCEDURE, SET, CONCAT, DECLARE, WHILE, and some basic mathematical formulas (SUM, COUNT)
